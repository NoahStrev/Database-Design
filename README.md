# Database-Design
-These are some of the Projects that I did in my database class
-We used the command prompt, mySQL, Microsoft Access, and Visual Studio 2019
-In these programs we focused on the entering of data, running various queries on the data
-Understanding the uses and meanings of different keys(foreign, primary, etc.), and drawing database diagrams
